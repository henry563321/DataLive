# DataLive - Object Relational Mapping in Rails

DataLive connects tables in the database with the class, you can call these class
'model'. Class connect with each other with the function called associations.

DataLive put a great focus on name conventions. We recommended you to use the
name of class or columns dealing with the association between tables, although
these mappings can be defined explicitly.

## Run the example demo

1. git clone https://github.com/henry563321/DataLive
2. bundle install
3. open pry
4. load 'sample/sample.rb'
5. you are all set! play around with Human, Food, Restaurant.
